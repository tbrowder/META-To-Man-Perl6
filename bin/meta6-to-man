   Usage: $*PROGRAM META6.json [options...]

     Produces a POSIX 'man' page from data in the Perl 6 META6 file.  The
     file is written to stdout if no options are used.  To produce the desired
     file, the user will normally want to fine-tune the output file with or
     more of the available options.

   Options:

     --man=F         Writes the man roff file to file 'F'. It is an error if
                     the file name does not end in .N where N is a digit in
                     the range 1..8.


     --install       Installs the output file to one of the standard man
                     directories. The directory actually chosen is the first
                     one found with write privileges for the user.  The
                     directories are searched in this order:

                       /usr/share/man/manN
                       /usr/local/share/man/manN
                       /usr/local/man/manN

     --install-to=D  Installs the output file to directory D.

     --debug         Normally for developer use.
