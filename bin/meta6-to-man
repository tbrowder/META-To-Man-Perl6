   Usage: $*PROGRAM META6.json [options...]

     Produces a POSIX 'man' page from data in the Perl 6 META6 file.  The
     file is written to stdout if no options are used.  To produce the desired
     file, the user will normally want to fine-tune the output file with or
     more of the available options.

   Options:

     --out=F   Writes the man roff file to file 'F'.

     --dir=D   The output is written to directory 'D'.
